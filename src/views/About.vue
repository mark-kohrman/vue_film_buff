    <h1>About 'Film Buff'</h1>
    <p> "Film Buff" is web application where you can search your favorite (or least favorite) movies and give them a thumbs up or thumbs down.  The best part?  You don't have to login and can vote as many times as you want.  It was created by Mark Kohrman, finished up in early 2021 as what started as an job application side, Mark ended up making his own.  Mark used a Ruby on Rails for backed, Vue.js for the frontend, Bootstrap for styling and a third party API called "omdbapi.com" to get all of the beautiful movie data.
