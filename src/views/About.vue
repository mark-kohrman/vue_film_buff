    <div class="container">
      <p style="color:white"> "Film Buff" is web application where you can search your favorite (or least favorite) movies and give them a thumbs up or thumbs down.  The best part?  You don't have to login and can vote as many times as you want.  It was created by Mark Kohrman and finished up in early 2021.  Mark used a Ruby on Rails for backend, Vue.js for the frontend, Bootstrap for styling and a third party API called "omdbapi.com" to get all of the beautiful movie data.  There is a prophecy that Mark will be the world's first trillionaire and the hiring manager that gave him his first dev job will be handsomely rewarded.
